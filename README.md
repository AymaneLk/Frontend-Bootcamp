# Frontend Bootcamp Website 
In this project i used the new version of **Bootstrap V-5.1** to build a Frontend Bootcamp website.

## Issues:
While I was coding the **Start the Enrollment** button I faced one issue this new version that I can't close the modal despite that I changed the button target Id and the modal Id.

## What's new with Bootstrap V-5.1:
**The most important feature:** Bootstrap 5 has come with major changes, including the drop for Internet Explorer (IE) support and jQuery dependency, which is a big dependency that takes a big size.
